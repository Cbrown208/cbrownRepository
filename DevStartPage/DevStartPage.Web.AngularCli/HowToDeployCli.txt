in order to deploy this solution you will need to build/compile and then publish to the desired location...

After that you will need to run "ng build --prod" at the project level and it will bundle up all the files into the "mainApp" folder. 

Once that folder has been generated copy it over to the IIS site and boom done! 


Steps to Follow:
1) publish the project to the website location.
2) run "ng build --prod"
3) Copy folder "mainApp" -> website location at the root level.
